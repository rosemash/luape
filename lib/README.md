# Why is it precompiled?

Because I found a precompiled version of it that worked with MinGW. I don't like compiling things. If this blob bugs you, submit a PR with the source included and a step added to build.sh, I'll merge it.

I got this file from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.1.5/Windows%20Libraries/Static/
